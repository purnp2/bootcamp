# Bootcamp Code Copied!

Hello!

I will be pushing the code from my bootcamp here also.
The original github page where all the projects' code are pushed regulary is: https://gitlab.crio.do/crio-786purn
However, it is a restricted account w/o public visibility. Hence, I am copying my commits to my personal Github also.
